# Image Generation Skill

## Overview

This skill generates high-quality images using structured prompts and a Python script. The workflow includes creating JSON-formatted prompts and executing image generation with optional reference images.

For **scientific illustrations** such as graphical abstracts, mechanism illustrations, concept explainers, or paper cover art, read `/mnt/skills/public/scientific-image-prompting/SKILL.md` first. That skill decides whether the request is allowed to use AIGC at all and defines the paper-ready prompt contract.

## Core Capabilities

- Create structured JSON prompts for AIGC image generation
- Support multiple reference images for style/composition guidance
- Generate images through automated Python script execution
- Handle various image generation scenarios (character design, scenes, products, etc.)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand Requirements

When a user requests image generation, identify:

- Subject/content: What should be in the image
- Style preferences: Art style, mood, color palette
- Technical specs: Aspect ratio, composition, lighting
- Reference images: Any images to guide generation
- You don't need to check the folder under `/mnt/user-data`

### Step 1.5: Reject Wrong Scientific Route

If the request is actually a real data figure, do **not** use this skill as the primary renderer.

Examples that must stay out of AIGC image generation:
- ROC / PR curves
- heatmaps
- volcano plots
- PCA / UMAP / t-SNE
- confusion matrices
- bar charts / line charts / histograms driven by real values

Route those requests to validated plotting workflows instead.

### Step 2: Create Structured Prompt

Generate a structured JSON file in `/mnt/user-data/workspace/` with naming pattern: `{descriptive-name}.json`

### Step 3: Execute Generation

Call the Python script:
```bash
python /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/prompt-file.json \
  --reference-images /path/to/ref1.jpg /path/to/ref2.png \
  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generated-image.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9
```

Parameters:

- `--prompt-file`: Absolute path to JSON prompt file (required)
- `--reference-images`: Absolute paths to reference images (optional, space-separated)
- `--output-file`: Absolute path to output image file (required)
- `--aspect-ratio`: Aspect ratio of the generated image (optional, default: 16:9)
- `--model`: Optional Google AI Studio image model
- `--image-size`: Optional `1K`, `2K`, or `4K`
- `--output-mime-type`: Optional `image/png` or `image/jpeg`
- `--scientific-mode`: Enables scientific illustration guardrails and 4K/PNG defaults
- `--manifest-file`: Optional manifest output path for generation audit
- `--draft-mode`: Lower-cost mode when no explicit model is provided

[!NOTE]
Do NOT read the python file, just call it with the parameters.

## Scientific Illustration Mode

When the request is a scientific illustration that passed the route check:

1. Read `/mnt/skills/public/scientific-image-prompting/SKILL.md`
2. Produce `prompt.json` using that contract
3. Generate the image in scientific mode
4. Keep the final output conceptual, not quantitative

Recommended command:

```bash
python /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/prompt.json \
  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/scientific-illustration-4k.png \
  --manifest-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/generation_manifest.json \
  --aspect-ratio 16:9 \
  --scientific-mode \
  --model gemini-3-pro-image-preview \
  --image-size 4K \
  --output-mime-type image/png
```

## Character Generation Example

User request: "Create a Tokyo street style woman character in 1990s"

Create prompt file: `/mnt/user-data/workspace/asian-woman.json`
```json
{
  "characters": [{
    "gender": "female",
    "age": "mid-20s",
    "ethnicity": "Japanese",
    "body_type": "slender, elegant",
    "facial_features": "delicate features, expressive eyes, subtle makeup with emphasis on lips, long dark hair partially wet from rain",
    "clothing": "stylish trench coat, designer handbag, high heels, contemporary Tokyo street fashion",
    "accessories": "minimal jewelry, statement earrings, leather handbag",
    "era": "1990s"
  }],
  "negative_prompt": "blurry face, deformed, low quality, overly sharp digital look, oversaturated colors, artificial lighting, studio setting, posed, selfie angle",
  "style": "Leica M11 street photography aesthetic, film-like rendering, natural color palette with slight warmth, bokeh background blur, analog photography feel",
  "composition": "medium shot, rule of thirds, subject slightly off-center, environmental context of Tokyo street visible, shallow depth of field isolating subject",
  "lighting": "neon lights from signs and storefronts, wet pavement reflections, soft ambient city glow, natural street lighting, rim lighting from background neons",
  "color_palette": "muted naturalistic tones, warm skin tones, cool blue and magenta neon accents, desaturated compared to digital photography, film grain texture"
}
```

Execute generation:
```bash
python /mnt/skills/public/image-generation/scripts/generate.py \
  --prompt-file /mnt/user-data/workspace/cyberpunk-hacker.json \
  --output-file /mnt/user-data/outputs/cyberpunk-hacker-01.jpg \
  --aspect-ratio 2:3
```

With reference images:
```json
{
  "characters": [{
    "gender": "based on [Image 1]",
    "age": "based on [Image 1]",
    "ethnicity": "human from [Image 1] adapted to Star Wars universe",

```

## Common Scenarios

Use different JSON schemas for different scenarios.

**Character Design**:
- Physical attributes (gender, age, ethnicity, body type)
- Facial features and expressions
- Clothing and accessories
- Historical era or setting
- Pose and context

**Scene Generation**:
- Environment description
- Time of day, weather
- Mood and atmosphere
- Focal points and composition

**Product Visualization**:
- Product details and materials
- Lighting setup
- Background and context
- Presentation angle

## Specific Templates

Read the following template file only when matching the user request.

- [Doraemon Comic](templates/doraemon.md)

## Output Handling

After generation:

- Images are typically saved in `/mnt/user-data/outputs/`
- In scientific mode, also preserve `generation_manifest.json`
- Share generated images with user using present_files tool
- Provide brief description of the generation result
- Offer to iterate if adjustments needed

## Tips: Enhancing Generation with Reference Images

For scenarios where visual accuracy is critical, **use the `image_search` tool first** to find reference images before generation.

**Recommended scenarios for using image_search tool:**
- **Character/Portrait Generation**: Search for similar poses, expressions, or styles to guide facial features and body proportions
- **Specific Objects or Products**: Find reference images of real objects to ensure accurate representation
- **Architectural or Environmental Scenes**: Search for location references to capture authentic details
- **Fashion and Clothing**: Find style references to ensure accurate garment details and styling

**Example workflow:**
1. Call the `image_search` tool to find suitable reference images:
   ```
   image_search(query="Japanese woman street photography 1990s", size="Large")
   ```
2. Download the returned image URLs to local files
3. Use the downloaded images as `--reference-images` parameter in the generation script

This approach significantly improves generation quality by providing the model with concrete visual guidance rather than relying solely on text descriptions.

## Quality Standards (Mandatory)

### Before Generation — Clarify Requirements
If ANY of the following are unclear, call `ask_clarification` BEFORE generating:
- What is the subject/scene? (character, product, environment, abstract)
- What style? (photorealistic, illustration, anime, oil painting, etc.)
- What mood/atmosphere? (dramatic, warm, mysterious, professional)
- What is the usage context? (social media, print, presentation, avatar)
- Aspect ratio preference? (16:9 landscape, 9:16 portrait, 1:1 square)

### Image Prompt Checklist
Apply these rules when creating the JSON prompt:

1. **Prompt length**: Minimum 150 words for any non-trivial image. Complex scenes need 200-300 words.
2. **Structure**: Always include [Subject] + [Action/Pose] + [Environment] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Color palette] + [Technical specs].
3. **Specificity**: Use exact descriptions, not vague terms. "warm golden hour sunlight at 15° angle" not "nice lighting". "#667eea deep purple" not "purple".
4. **Negative prompt**: Always include `negative_prompt` to exclude unwanted elements (blur, deformation, low quality, etc.).
5. **Reference images**: For characters, products, or specific styles — use `image_search` tool first to find references, then pass via `--reference-images`.
6. **Composition**: Specify camera angle, framing (close-up/medium/wide), depth of field, and rule of thirds placement.
7. **Style consistency**: For image series, reference previous outputs and explicitly state "match the style of the reference image exactly".

### After Generation — Self-Review
Before presenting the image to the user:
- [ ] Does the image match the requested subject and style?
- [ ] Is the composition balanced with a clear focal point?
- [ ] Are colors harmonious and appropriate for the mood?
- [ ] Is the quality sufficient? (no artifacts, blur, or deformation)
- [ ] For series: is it visually consistent with previous images?

If quality is insufficient, refine the prompt (add more detail, adjust negative_prompt) and regenerate. Max 2 retries before presenting to user with notes on what could be improved.

## Notes

- Always use English for prompts regardless of user's language
- JSON format ensures structured, parsable prompts
- Reference images enhance generation quality significantly
- Iterative refinement is normal for optimal results
- For character generation, include the detailed character object plus a consolidated prompt field
