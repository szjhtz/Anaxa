# Academic Deep Research

Use this skill when the user asks for:

- academic reports or literature reviews
- experiment reports with professional references
- APA-style references or richer scholarly citations
- innovation-point mining based on papers
- a research knowledge base, evidence map, or local literature store

## Core Rules

1. Prefer the `academic_research` tool over ad hoc web browsing when the task is literature-heavy.
2. For large academic tasks, delegate to `task` with `subagent_type="academic-researcher"` so the main thread stays clean.
3. Do not invent references, DOI metadata, or claims that are not grounded in the generated evidence bundle.
4. Treat the generated `report.md`, `references.md`, `references.bib`, and `evidence_map.json` as the source of truth.
5. When writing final prose in chat, use the artifact bundle first and only then polish wording.

## Recommended Workflow

### 1. Start Structured Research

If the user gives a research topic, run:

- `academic_research(topic=..., scope=...)`

This will automatically:

- expand queries
- retrieve and normalize papers
- deduplicate and rank them
- produce a report bundle

### 2. Escalate to Subagent When Needed

If the task is large, multi-part, or the user wants a full report, use:

- `task(description=..., prompt=..., subagent_type="academic-researcher")`

The subagent should use `academic_research` as its primary tool and then summarize the bundle.

### 3. Output Discipline

When summarizing the generated academic bundle:

- mention `project_id`
- mention how many core papers and APA references were retained
- mention any evidence gaps
- point the user to the artifacts instead of rewriting everything inline

## What Good Looks Like

- the report is evidence-backed rather than generic
- the references list is materially richer than a normal web-search answer
- APA entries are normalized and deduplicated
- innovation directions are tied to literature gaps, not speculation
