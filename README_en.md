  <b>An AI Research Agent Platform for Academic Writing and Experiment Reports</b><br/>
  Literature Retrieval · Multi-Style References · Experimental Evidence · Multi-Agent Collaboration
</p>

---

MedrixFlow is a full-stack AI agent orchestration platform for academic writing, literature reviews, experiment reports, and research delivery. The backend uses LangGraph for multi-agent collaboration and state management, while the frontend provides a thread-based chat and artifact workflow built on Next.js 16. Beyond general-purpose agent capabilities, MedrixFlow now includes structured academic retrieval, multi-style reference export, CS/AI and bioinformatics experiment specialist agents, local evidence storage, and report-oriented artifact delivery, with research, literature, and experiment intent routed automatically from normal chat. It is designed to solve the usual gaps in academic workflows: weak scholarly grounding, poor references, and disconnected experiment outputs.

## Key Features

### 1. Academic Research Pipeline: From Topic to User-Selected References

MedrixFlow now includes backend-routed research capabilities for formal academic reporting:

- **Built-in academic subagent**: `academic-researcher` handles topic decomposition, query expansion, candidate paper screening, evidence card generation, outline building, and reference export
- **Chat-native research routing**: prompts about literature, papers, citations, APA/BibTeX, evidence maps, or related work are routed toward `academic_research`, with complex deliverables delegated to `academic-researcher` when appropriate
- **Formal-source-first CS/AI stack**: the default `cs_ai` path uses `DBLP`, `OpenReview`, `ACL Anthology`, `Semantic Scholar`, `OpenAlex`, `Crossref`, and `arXiv`, with conference/journal versions preferred as the canonical reference
- **Formal report exports**: a single research project can produce `report.md`, `references.md` formatted in the user's requested style, `references.bib`, `evidence_map.json`, `retrieval_audit.json`, and optionally `graph.json`
- **Local evidence persistence**: research projects, paper metadata, evidence cards, outline mappings, and formatted references are stored locally in SQLite for incremental reuse

### 2. Experiment Specialist Agents: CS/AI and Bioinformatics

MedrixFlow does not stop at writing. It also closes the gap between experiments and paper-ready outputs:

- **Visible system agents**: `cs-ai-lab` focuses on regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction, diagnostics, and paper-ready result summaries; `bioinformatics-lab` focuses on bulk expression workflows, differential analysis, enrichment, and single-cell starter analyses
- **Python-first execution**: experiment workflows run through a unified local Python path to reduce runtime switching and keep outputs reproducible
- **autoresearch-style iteration**: model training, ablation, and code-tuning tasks can use a baseline-first loop with a fixed evaluation harness, primary metric, trial log, and `keep` / `discard` / `crash` records without importing external training code
- **Automatic scientific figure routing**: chart type is selected from task intent and data shape, including line plots, histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps, ROC/PR, volcano, violin, and dot plots
- **Paper-ready export bundle**: experiments can export `experiment_plan.md`, `methods.md`, `results.md`, `metrics.json`, `figure_manifest.json`, `figures/`, `tables/`, and when needed `paper_ready_results.md`

### 3. Thread-Level Delivery and Artifact Discovery

Academic workflows only work if users can reliably find the generated outputs:

- **Thread-level outputs directory**: reports, BibTeX, figures, and result tables are written into the current thread’s artifact directory
- **Improved right-side file panel**: the artifact panel supports auto-discovery of thread `outputs`, a manual refresh button, latest-file highlighting, preview, and download
- **Delivery over chat spam**: larger research tasks prefer artifact bundles instead of forcing long reports into a single chat message

### 4. LangGraph-Powered Multi-Agent Orchestration

Unlike simple LLM chaining, MedrixFlow uses a **LangGraph directed graph state machine** as its orchestration core:

- **Lead Agent + Subagent architecture**: the lead agent handles task understanding and decomposition, delegating to up to 3 subagents in parallel, each with a 15-minute timeout
- **Multi-layer middleware chain**: a strictly ordered pipeline handles thread isolation, uploads, sandbox lifecycle, security auditing, summarization, memory extraction, loop detection, tool error degradation, token tracking, and visual quality gating
- **Dynamic model hot-swapping**: conversations can switch LLMs mid-thread, with model capabilities declared through flags such as `supports_thinking`, `supports_reasoning_effort`, and `supports_vision`

### 5. Thread-Level Sandbox Isolation

Each conversation thread has a fully isolated execution environment:

- **Virtual filesystem mapping**: `/mnt/user-data/{workspace,uploads,outputs}` is mapped to thread-specific physical directories to prevent cross-thread data leakage
- **Dual sandbox engine**: supports local direct execution (`LocalSandboxProvider`) and Docker-based isolation (`AioSandboxProvider`), with K3s pod isolation as a production option
- **Complete toolchain coverage**: bash execution, file read/write, string replacement, and directory browsing are all available inside the isolated workspace

### 6. LLM-Driven Persistent Memory

Unlike simple history concatenation, MedrixFlow implements a structured long-term memory system:

- **Automatic knowledge extraction**: the LLM extracts user background, preferences, facts, and context from conversations
- **User correction detection**: 11 EN/ZH regex patterns detect corrections in real time and prioritize memory updates
- **Debounced batch processing**: multi-turn changes are aggregated with a configurable debounce window (default 30s) to reduce LLM overhead
- **Pluggable storage backend**: JSON file storage is the default, but `storage_class` can be swapped for SQLite, Redis, or custom implementations
- **System prompt injection**: high-confidence facts and user context are automatically injected into prompts for cross-session personalization

### 7. Streaming and Zero-Config Frontend UX

MedrixFlow keeps the UX production-ready through the LangGraph SDK’s `useStream` and a frontend-first setup flow:

- **SSE streaming rendering**: responses, thinking traces, and subagent progress stream in real time
- **Automatic disconnection recovery**: `reconnectOnMount + streamResumable` allows recovery after refresh or network interruption while backend execution continues
- **Frontend-first setup**: model and API key configuration is handled in the UI and hot-reloaded into the app
- **Modes map to reasoning depth**: `flash / thinking / pro / ultra` expose higher-level behavior, reasoning effort, and subagent capability instead of low-level model toggles

### 8. Visual Quality, Security Auditing, and Observability

The platform also keeps strong delivery quality and operational visibility:

- **Visual quality gates**: `visual_quality_check` and `visual_refinement_check` enforce structured QA before charts, PPT, or image outputs are delivered
- **Dedicated visual subagent**: `visual-specialist` handles high-quality visual generation and iterative refinement
- **Bash command auditing**: `SandboxAuditMiddleware` classifies every bash call into block / warn / pass and records audit logs
- **Token usage tracking**: `TokenUsageMiddleware` records input / output / total token counts per LLM call
- **Sandbox security awareness**: `security.py` exposes helpers to determine the current sandbox security level at runtime

## Current Interaction Notes

### Academic Reports and File Delivery

- Academic research and experiment tasks write outputs such as `report.md`, `references.md`, `references.bib`, figures, and result tables into the current thread’s `outputs`
- The right-side file panel auto-discovers these artifacts and supports **manual refresh**, **latest-file highlighting**, preview, and download
- When a task is better delivered as files than as chat prose, the agent prefers returning an artifact bundle that can be reused directly in writing workflows

### Automatic Research Routing

- The sidebar no longer exposes a separate "Research" entry; the primary workflow is normal chat, while `/workspace/research` remains available as an internal or direct Research Dashboard
- Literature reviews, citations, APA/BibTeX, related work, and evidence mapping prefer `academic_research`, with complex deliverables delegated to `academic-researcher`
- `research_assistant` is used only when the user clearly asks for a staged research-project lifecycle, stage advancement, novelty checks, experiment gates, reviewer loops, or final bundle release
- Review, survey, manuscript, and paper-draft tasks activate a review-quality profile: 50 minimum usable references, 80 target references, 30 core papers, and a persisted `reference_coverage_audit`
- Research quest review/final stages persist `ResearchQualityAudit` records for citation density, reference coverage, off-topic references, quantitative/benchmark evidence, feasibility discussion, repeated or over-absolute wording, and process-note residue; auto-repair runs before handing control back to a human gate
- Real data experiments, model evaluation, bioinformatics analysis, and scientific figures continue to route through `experiment_lab`

### Clarification and Confirmation

- When the agent needs more information or explicit approval, it calls `ask_clarification`
- In the web UI, these requests are rendered as button-based choices instead of plain text only
- Each clarification card includes a final `type something` option so the user can switch back to free-form input

### LaTeX / PDF Preview

- When `present_files` is used on a `.tex` file, the app attempts to generate a preview PDF automatically
- The current implementation prefers local `tectonic` and does not require `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, or `latexmk`
- The preview pipeline also applies common compatibility fixes such as downloading remote images, injecting `subfig`, and normalizing some Unicode sub/superscripts

### Production Security Requirements

- Production deployments must explicitly set `MEDRIX_FLOW_ENV=production` so the Python services enable their production safety guards and reject `LocalSandboxProvider`
- When nginx exposes the UI/API, `MEDRIX_FLOW_UI_PASSWORD` must be configured or `/workspace`, `/api/*`, `/api/langgraph/*`, and `/docs` will fail closed
- For scripted access to protected endpoints, you can additionally configure `MEDRIX_GATEWAY_ADMIN_TOKEN` and send it as the `x-medrix-admin-token` header

### Skills and Extensions

- Skills are auto-discovered from `skills/public` and `skills/custom`
- Skill enablement state and MCP configuration are stored together in `extensions_config.json`
- Users can enable or disable skills from the settings page, or drop custom skills directly into `skills/custom`
- Current public skills cover academic deep research, experiment analysis, data analysis, Nature-style figures, PPT/image/video/podcast generation, web design, skill/plugin helpers, and GitHub deep research workflows

### Academic / Experiment APIs

| Route | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `POST /api/academic/projects` | Create or reuse an academic project bound to a `thread_id` and topic |
| `POST /api/academic/projects/{project_id}/ingest` | Retrieve papers from multiple sources, normalize metadata, deduplicate, and build the evidence pool |
| `POST /api/academic/projects/{project_id}/synthesize` | Generate the formal report, requested-style references, BibTeX, and evidence mapping files; `reference_style` defaults to APA 7 only when omitted |
| `GET /api/academic/projects/{project_id}/references?style=gbt7714` | Read references in the requested style; supports `apa7`, `mla9`, `chicago`, `gbt7714`, `plain`, and `bibtex` |
| `POST /api/research/quests` | Create a staged research quest from backend flows or the direct Research Dashboard |
| `POST /api/research/quests/{quest_id}/advance` | Advance intake, literature, novelty, evidence, experiment, manuscript, review, and final bundle stages |
| `POST /api/research/quests/{quest_id}/gate` | Record human gate decisions for experiment execution, pre-review, and final release |
| `POST /api/experiments/projects` | Create an experiment project bound to an expert agent, datasets, and an optional academic project |
| `POST /api/experiments/projects/{project_id}/execute` | Run the experiment pipeline and generate metrics, figures, and result summaries |
| `POST /api/experiments/projects/{project_id}/export` | Export the experiment bundle, optionally including `paper_ready_results.md` |

## Academic Writing Additions

- **Literature review / related work**: given a topic, MedrixFlow can use `academic-researcher` with `academic-deep-research` to expand queries, search multiple academic sources, deduplicate, and build a core paper pool with evidence mappings
- **Multi-style references**: formal report workflows export all verified canonical references in the user's requested style without an export cap, along with `references.md`, `references.bib`, and `retrieval_audit.json`; APA 7 remains the compatibility default when no style is specified
- **Experiment-backed writing**: `cs-ai-lab` and `bioinformatics-lab` can turn structured datasets or expression analyses into figures, tables, methods, and results bundles, reducing the gap between prose and evidence
- **Controlled iterative experiments**: inspired by the autoresearch-style pattern, model training and ablation work emphasizes baselines, fixed metrics, fixed evaluation budgets, and `keep` / `discard` / `crash` logs instead of unconstrained code changes
- **Local evidence reuse**: academic and experiment projects can be incrementally reused in the same thread, so follow-up literature, references, and experiments do not have to start from scratch
- **Artifact-first delivery**: the right-side artifact panel is now better suited for locating newly generated reports, figures, and references without repeatedly asking the agent to resend them

## Quick Start

Get MedrixFlow running in just 4 steps — **no manual config file editing required**.

### Step 1: Install Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Installation |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Python | 3.12+ | [python.org](https://www.python.org/) |
| uv | Latest | `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh \| sh` |

| nginx | - | macOS: `brew install nginx` / Linux: `sudo apt install nginx` |
| tectonic | Recommended | Local PDF preview/export for `.tex` files |

### Step 2: Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Citrus-bit/medrix-flow.git
cd medrix-flow
make config    # Auto-generate config.yaml and .env (first time only)
make install   # One-command install for all frontend and backend dependencies (backend includes dev dependency group)
```

### Step 3: Start Services

```bash
make dev       # Start all services (LangGraph + Gateway + Frontend + Nginx)
```

Once started, your browser will automatically open http://localhost:1000

> You can also use `make dev-daemon` to start in the background, or double-click `start.command` for one-click launch.

### Step 4: Configure Models & API Keys in the UI

When you first open the page, the setup panel will **automatically pop up** to guide you through configuration:

1. **Add a Model**: On the "Configuration" page, select a provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Google Gemini / DeepSeek / OpenAI Compatible) and enter the model name
2. **Enter API Key**: Input your API Key and click the "Test" button to verify connectivity
3. **Configure Image / Tool / Academic Keys** (optional): If you need scientific image generation, web search, or academic retrieval enhancement, choose an active image provider (Google AI Studio or OpenAI-compatible), then enter the required API keys for image generation, Tavily / Jina, and OpenAlex / Semantic Scholar
4. **Save Configuration** — Done! Configuration is automatically persisted and the service hot-reloads

> You can reopen the configuration panel at any time via the bottom-left "Settings & More" → "Settings" → "Configuration" tab.

## Configuration

### Frontend UI Configuration (Recommended)

MedrixFlow supports managing all model and API key configurations directly through the web interface:

- **Model Management**: Add / edit / delete LLM models, supporting preset providers and OpenAI Compatible mode
- **Connectivity Testing**: Each model configuration has a "Test" button that dynamically instantiates the Provider to verify availability
- **Tool API Keys**: Configure Tavily (web search) and Jina (web scraping) keys
- **Instant Effect**: Saving automatically writes to `config.yaml` and `.env`, and the service hot-reloads
- **Capabilities Default On**: Thinking and vision capabilities are enabled by default in model setup; the frontend no longer exposes separate toggles for them

**How to open**: Bottom-left "Settings & More" → "Settings" → "Configuration" tab

### Manual Configuration (Advanced Users)

Edit `config.yaml` in the project root directory directly. Main configuration sections:

| Section | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `models` | LLM model definitions (class paths, API Keys, capability flags such as `supports_thinking`, `supports_reasoning_effort`, and `supports_vision`) |
| `tools` | Tool definitions (module paths, groups) |
| `sandbox` | Execution environment (local / Docker / K3s) + `allow_host_bash` security switch |
| `skills` | Skill directory paths |
| `memory` | Memory system (enabled, storage, debounce, fact limit, storage backend class path) |
| `summarization` | Context summarization (trigger strategy, retention policy) |
| `subagents` | Subagents (timeout configuration) |
| `channels` | IM channels (Feishu/Slack/Telegram) |
| `guardrails` | Tool call authorization guards |
| `token_usage` | Token usage tracking (enabled/disabled) |
| `checkpointer` | State persistence (memory/sqlite/postgres) |

### Environment Variables

Configuration values prefixed with `$` are automatically resolved as environment variables. Common variables:

- Model API Keys: `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
- Tool / image / academic API Keys: `TAVILY_API_KEY`, `JINA_API_KEY`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `IMAGE_GEN_ACTIVE_PROVIDER`, `IMAGE_GEN_GOOGLE_MODEL`, `IMAGE_GEN_OPENAI_MODEL`, `IMAGE_GEN_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `IMAGE_GEN_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `OPENALEX_API_KEY`, `SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY`
- Config overrides: `MEDRIX_FLOW_CONFIG_PATH`, `MEDRIX_FLOW_EXTENSIONS_CONFIG_PATH`

### MCP and Skills Configuration (`extensions_config.json`)

You can copy `extensions_config.example.json` from the project root as a starting point, or manage it from the settings UI.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "github": {
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": { "GITHUB_TOKEN": "$GITHUB_TOKEN" }
    }
  }
}
```
